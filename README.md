# Introducing

This Django project is test platform for your skills in different subjects. 
Database is sqlite, but you can choose anyone, just edit `django_test_platform/settings.py`.
Also if you want to migrate data from my demo init, you can see [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18671/quick-easy-way-to-migrate-sqlite3-to-mysql) for MySQL.

# How to run

If you installed django and python earlier, then just run:

`$ python manage.py runserver`

And see result in browser at address: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` 

If you don't have django, then see instruction for your OS [here](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/intro/install/).
